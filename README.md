Used for my own benefit

## Jenkins

- Configure a Jenkins environment on local machine similar to what we do at work
    - Jenkins Operator
    - Jenkins Seed yaml configuration
- Study Jenkins running on Kubernetes
- Revise how the Jenkins Operator works
- Create build clouds on namespace
- Create a pipeline that will use my own container to deploy within itself.
- Jenkins Libraries and how to configure them
- Create a terraform deployment for provisioning things for local use (ECR Permissions maybe)

## Things to do

1. Create a local cluster deployment
2. Create a Jenkins deployment
3. Be able to connect to that Jenkins environment
